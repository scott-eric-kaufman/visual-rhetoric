## The two distinct styles of Elysium’s camera work create two realities

All film is illusion. They were originally called “moving pictures” for a reason: Films lie to their audiences, convincing them that the series of still-frames flipping before their eyes capture a slice of reality. Film provided unmitigated access to the world, especially when the camera appeared to be operated by a hyperactive toddler with the DTs.

The cinema verité, or observational mode of filming reminds audiences that there are eyes and minds behind the camera, which, ironically, makes the film itself seem less mitigated and “more real.” It sees the inherent illusion of film and doubles down: “You can tell this is authentically captured,” such works assure audiences, “because even we don’t know what’s going to happen.” The camera is typically a beat behind the action, and when it figures out where it wants to go, it slightly overshoots the subject and then re-frames.

Single-camera comedies like [*Arrested Development*](http://www.avclub.com/tv/arrested-development/)*, *[*Louie*](http://www.avclub.com/tv/louie/), and [*Parks And Recreation*](http://www.avclub.com/tv/parks-and-recreation/) use belated reaction shots in a way that captures the characters thinking about how they reacted as opposed to the reaction itself. Traditional sitcoms, then, seem more scripted and “less real” by comparison. Of course, both single-camera comedies and traditional sitcoms are scripted, and the idea that one is more realistic than the other is just a function of the illusion created by deliberately imperfect camerawork.

 At this point, though, the techniques of cinema verité are so ubiquitous that they pass below the threshold of what viewers notice. No one watches an episode of *Law & Order: SVU* and mistakes Big Boi being eaten by a pack of hyenas while detectives shoot a man smuggling a monkey in a basketball for the evening news. Such shows only—or better yet, merely—look realistic, but they lack the punch of immediacy that those early cinema verité films provided. At this point, the only way to recreate the illusion that film isn’t an illusion is to create contrast within a given work.

Neill Blomkamp’s [*Elysium*](http://www.avclub.com/review/elysium-101238) accomplishes this by embracing distinct styles for its two central settings: the poor-inherited Earth and the Space Hamptons. For example, when Matt Damon’s character Max walks to work early in the film, here is how the camera initially frames his head...

There’s nothing inherently realistic about Damon’s head-bobbing, but it does create a disorderly impression: Damon is an uncooperative subject or the terrain is too chaotic for the camera to follow him smoothly or a combination of the two, but it doesn’t matter, because the overall effect communicates an unruliness.

When Blomkamp tracks Jodi Foster’s Delacourt walking toward the camera on Deep Space 1 Percent, however...

Its orderliness seems unreal, which is exactly the impression Blomkamp hoped to create: Foster’s character controls a wealthy society whose power is maintained by an inhuman and inhumane disciplinary apparatus. Shots of the Elysium satellite seem *too* perfect, as if they are the product of a previous generation of computer-generated effects. Consider the first shot of the station itself...

Blomkamp deliberately echoes the most iconic shot of a space station on this side of the Alderaan system...

![501299](images/film/elysium/501299.jpg)

The camera steadily pans to an image of the future that already feels old, which is only fitting, given that this is a CGI homage to an effect that’s merely “special.” The ostensible perfection of the Elysium station seems both obsolete and fundamentally wrong, which is also fitting, given that it’s essentially an orbital uncanny valley...

Everything appears too orderly, because everything is too orderly. The chaotic shots of Damon on Earth aren’t realistic, because cinema verité has a monopoly on realism as a visual mode—they only appear more realistic in comparison to the inhuman tidiness of the images of Foster’s life on Elysium.

By pitting these modes of living against each other visually, Blomkamp breathes life into the now-tired notion that the real world is “dark and gritty.” Neither vision of the world is more accurate than the other—the “truth,” whatever it may be, must be somewhere in between.
