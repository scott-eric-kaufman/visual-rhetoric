#### Note from the Editor

It has been my profound pleasure in the period of 2014-2016 to get to know Scott Eric Kaufmann -- or, as his chosen nom-de-plume, "*SEK*". After having reached out to him in the fall of 2014 regarding a technical matter, we subsequently struck up a friendship which included the collation of his body of work for this book. He had mentioned that, although he had been in talks with publishers to create a textbook from this material, the royalties for screen grabs (which should have ideally been covered under Fair Use exceptions to copyright, as they tick off all of the respective prerequisites) were proving too onerous for the publisher to license. His strategy was to be to "go rogue" with the material.

I functioned as a sort of intellectual go-fer for Scott, as I make a reasonably good research assistant.

The unfortunate epilogue to this introduction is that Scott suffered from extremely ill health and, following an incident in the late fall of 2016, elected to be taken off of life support after spending over a month in an Intensive Care Unit.

I have always maintained that the measure of a man is what he leaves behind and how he affects those whose lives he has touched. By that measure, Scott Eric Kaufman is one of the greatest. I'm honored to have been able to write an informal introduction to his work.

Thank you,
